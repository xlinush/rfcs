# OpenClaw RFCs

This repository stores design proposals and longer-form technical decisions for
OpenClaw.

## Structure

RFC documents live under the `rfcs/` subdirectory at the repository root:

```text
.
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
└── rfcs/
    ├── 0000-template.md
    ├── <id>-<short-name>.md
    └── <id>/
```

New RFCs should use the template and follow the structure below when diagrams or
supporting assets are needed:

```text
.
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
└── rfcs/
    ├── 0000-template.md
    ├── <id>-<short-name>.md
    └── <id>/
        ├── architecture-overview.png
        └── other-assets...
```

The Markdown file is the RFC. The sibling `<id>/` directory inside `rfcs/` is
optional and is used only for assets referenced by that RFC.

## Naming

- `rfcs/0000-template.md` is the starter template for new RFCs.
- New RFCs should be named `<id>-<short-name>.md`.
- When an RFC has supporting assets, store them under a sibling folder inside
  `rfcs/` named exactly `<id>/`.

Example:

```text
.
└── rfcs/
    ├── 0123-policy-runtime-hardening.md
    └── 0123/
        └── architecture-overview.png
```

## Asset References

Reference assets with repo-relative paths from the RFC file:

```md
![](0123/architecture-overview.png)
```

This keeps the RFC portable and lets GitHub render the document and images
together.

## RFC Template Shape

New RFCs should start from [`rfcs/0000-template.md`](./rfcs/0000-template.md).
The template keeps a compact RFC shape while borrowing the core proposal habits
from Go and Rust: short summary, explicit motivation, concrete proposal text,
rationale for the chosen approach, and clear unresolved questions.

RFC metadata should live in YAML frontmatter at the top of each RFC. The
template currently uses these metadata keys:

- `title`
- `authors`
- `created`
- `last_updated`
- `rfc_pr`

The expected top-level sections are:

- `Summary`
- `Motivation`
- `Goals`
- `Non-Goals`
- `Proposal`
- `Rationale`
- `Unresolved questions`

## Authoring Notes

- Keep one RFC per Markdown file.
- Use the sidecar asset folder only when the RFC needs diagrams, screenshots, or
  other supporting files.
- Prefer stable filenames for images so review comments and links do not churn.
- Keep assets specific to one RFC in that RFC's own `<id>/` directory rather
  than creating a shared global asset folder.
- Keep `Summary` to one paragraph.
- Use `Motivation` to explain why the change is necessary.
- Use `Goals` to define what success looks like for the proposal.
- Use `Non-Goals` to define what is intentionally out of scope.
- Use `Proposal` to describe what is changing.
- Use `Rationale` to compare alternatives and explain the tradeoffs in the
  chosen design.
- Use `Unresolved questions` to call out relevant gaps or follow-up areas that
  are intentionally not addressed by the proposal.
